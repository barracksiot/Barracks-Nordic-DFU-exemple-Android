## Using Barracks and Nordic ##

* Don't forget to enter your API key in the BarracksHelper init

## How it works ? ##

* 1 : Find the advertising NRF52 by scanning bluetooth device
* 2 : Once we found the device, let use Barracks to check if an update is available for the versionID we wrote.
* 3 : If an update is available, let's proceed to the installation by downloading update using BarracksHelper then push it on the NRF52 to update the firmware using the Nordic DFU Library.
